## Overview
This is my solution to the Blog preview card challenge. Looking at other people's code I can tell that my code is not very sophisticated. But I am a beginner at this, so I think I am ok with that. I will keep adding more of the things that I learn to my solutions as I go along. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I put together the HTML elements and then tried to replicate the design using CSS. I was looking into different ways to add the custom fonts. I noticed that it was already downloaded into the project files, so I wanted to use the files. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about fonts. 

### Continued development

Looking at other peoples solutions, I see that I can still work with variables in my CSS, to make it more sophisticated. 

### Useful resources

VSCode together with Copilot was very helpful.
